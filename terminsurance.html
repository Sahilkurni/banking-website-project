            What is a Term Insurance Plan?<br>
            A term insurance plan is a pure protection life insurance plan.<br> A pure term insurance plan provides a large sum of money to your nominees in <br>case of your demise within the policy term.<br> The financial benefit from the policy is the death benefit,<br> which you can select at the time of buying the policy as the sum assured.<br> In the event of an unfortunate death, the term life insurance cover will provide a <br>large sum of money to the beneficiaries so that they can:
            
            <br>a) Look after their regular monthly living expenses.<br>
            
            b) Pay off any financial liabilities like a car loan or housing loan you had.<br>
            
            c) Invest money towards achieving important life goals like childrenâ€™s <br>education and marriage, a retirement fund for their spouse.<br>
            
            For example, you are 30 years old, a non-smoker male and want to buy a<br> Rs 2 crore term life cover for your family. The cover should protect them for the next<br> 30 years until your retirement. You will need to pay about Rs 2000 per month as a premium under the regular premium payment option.<br>
            
            You can also choose shorter premium payment tenures such as single premium, 5, 10 or 15 years, etc.</P>
