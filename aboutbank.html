            <hr color="aqua">

            <p class="deepinf">Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) represent an innovation in Indian Banking. The innovation is
                unique in terms of its objectives, functions, area of operation and clientele. For this reasons, RRBs
                can be
                regarded as specialized Institutions, i.e. distinct from commercial banks as well as Co-operative credit
                agencies.

                The Banking Commission in the year 1972 observed that despite the massive expansion of branch network of
                commercial Banks in the rural areas, a vast segment of the rural population comprising weaker sections
                and
                economically backward classes were deprived of banking facilities as their requirements were small and
                financing them by commercial banks was perceived to be a non-viable proposition. The Commission felt
                that an
                alternative credit delivery mechanism by way of setting up of specialized Banks, particularly to cater
                to
                these segments of the population, could be explored by the Government. Based on the recommendations of
                Narasimhan Committee which gave its report in 1975, the Government of India decided to set up Regional
                Rural
                Bank (RRBs). Regional rural Banks Ordinance was promulgated by the President of India on September
                26,1975.
                Accordingly, Five RRBs started functioning from 2nd October 1975. The Ordinance was subsequently
                replaced by
                the Regional Rural Bankâ€™s Act, 1976 dated February 9,1976. This Act provide for incorporation,
                regulation
                and winding up Regional Rural Banks. This Act contains all provisions for the proper functioning of RRBs
                and
                its supervision by NABARD and RBI as a regulator.</p>

                <b>A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS:</b>
                <hr color="aqua">

                <p>RRBs faced many ups and downs during the last 46 years since its inception because it was a new and
                unique concept ever
                implemented in the country. The number of RRBs which increased from 5 to 196 during expansion phase from
                1976 to 1986 showed the willingness of Govt. of India and the concerned State Governments looking to its
                objectives. Various recommendations of Committee pointed out the need of increasing the size of RRBs to
                make
                them economical viable. With this view the %E2%80%9Cmerger%E2%80%9D of RRBs took place during 2005
                onwards.
                They are successfully competing with their banking counter parts in rural areas with the implementation
                of
                computerization and Core Banking solutions (CBS) with the active support of Govt. of India and NABARD.In
                view of restructuring of RRBs, the Government of India has taken a decision to amalgamate the RRBs
                sponsored
                by the same commercial Bank, which are existing in a particular State. Accordingly, in Karnataka State,
                our
                Bank namely Karnataka Vikas Grameena Bank has come in to existence with effect from 12th September 2005
                by
                amalgamating 4 erstwhile RRBs namely Malaprabha, Bijapur, Varada and Netravati Grameena Banks. The bank
                is
                operating in almost 1/3rd of the geographical area of Karnataka state consisting of 6 districts of
                northern
                Karnataka (Bagalkote, Belagavi, Vijayapura, Dharwad, Gadag,Haveri ) and 3 districts of coastal Karnataka
                (Uttar Kannada ,Mangaluru and Udupi).Head quartered in Dharwad, it has ten Regional Offices (Dharwad,

                development of rural areas since the very beginning. The upliftment of weaker sections and the down
